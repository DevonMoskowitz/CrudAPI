# CrudAPI - Devon Moskowitz
This is the project I worked on for CSC340 for the CRUDAPI section. 

An Animal has the following attributes:

animalId - (int) a unique identifier for an animal, autogenerated.
name - (String) nonnull.
scientificName - (String) may be null.
species - (String) nonnull.
habitat - (String) nonnull.
description - (String) may be null.
The API must have endpoints to achieve the following:

Get all animals.
Get an animal by its ID.
Add a new animal.
Update an existing animal.
Delete an existing animal.
Get all animals of a given species.
Get animals whose name contains a string, (for example the search key "blue" could return [Blue Jay, Great Blue Heron, Russian Blue Cat, Blue Poison Dart Frog] etc.)
